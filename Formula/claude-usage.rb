  # Pinned to the PREVIOUS release's tag tarball, never this formula's own
  # release: the formula ships inside the repo it installs, so a self-pointing
  # sha256 would be uncomputable (the tarball would contain this very hash).
  # It therefore tracks one release behind by design — bump to the prior tag
  # each release. See AGENTS.md "Homebrew formula and self-referential SHA".
