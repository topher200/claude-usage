# Changelog

## v1.2.4 — 2026-05-30

### Dashboard

- Recoloured the dashboard to a warm, neutral palette aligned with the Claude Code interface (less blue): page `#161617`, cards `#1E1F20`, lighter text `#BFBFBF`, plus a `--raised` hover layer and a dedicated `--red`. Switched to an elevated layering model — cards sit *above* the page (lighter), hover lighter still — replacing the previous inverted scheme.
- Reworked chart colours: a warm, Anthropic-leaning donut palette (clay/tan/sage/dusty-blue/…); token series are blue / coral / green / amber; chart axis & legend text use a slightly lighter shade so small labels stay legible on the dark cards.
- Chart hovers now lighten consistently (bars/series go to full opacity; the doughnut pops the hovered slice). Tooltip colour swatches are solid and borderless — removed Chart.js's default white `multiKeyBackground` edge. The hourly chart's legend/tooltip use a coral circle for the output line and a blue square for the turns bars.
- Legend series toggles now persist across repaints (filter changes, auto-refresh, sorting) for every chart, including per-slice visibility on the doughnut.
- Header title and gauge icon now use the lightest text colour (neutral) instead of coral. Selected model chips use a neutral background with a coral border; range / timezone tabs use a neutral selected background (no orange).
- Cost values use thousand separators (e.g. `$1,050.49`).
- Header meta puts "Auto-refresh in 30s" on its own line, with more space before the Rescan button.
- Removed the ⚡ peak-hour markers from the hourly axis labels (they collided with the axis; peak hours are still shown by the red bars and the legend).
- Fixed a stale "Apr 2026" stat sublabel → "May 2026".

### Extension

- The loading / status screen now matches the dashboard header — same gauge icon (served via a webview URI), title, and elevated-palette colours — instead of the old coral heading on a mismatched background.

## v1.2.3 — 2026-05-30

### Extension

- Fixed CSV export (Download CSV buttons / "Download CSV to see all" links) not working inside the VS Code webview. The dashboard iframe's sandbox was missing `allow-downloads`, so Chromium silently blocked the Blob download; added the token. Keeps the export client-side, so it still respects the current model/range/sort filters.
- The extension no longer pops a system browser tab when opening the dashboard — it passes the new `--no-browser` flag to the bundled `cli.py dashboard`. Running `python cli.py dashboard` as a script still opens the browser as before.
- Matched the webview's pre-load / behind-iframe background to the dashboard (`#191A1B`), removing the brief `#0f1117` flash before the dashboard renders.

### Scanner / CLI

- Added a `--no-browser` flag to `cli.py dashboard` to start the server without opening a browser (used by the VS Code extension; standalone CLI usage is unchanged).

## v1.2.2 — 2026-05-30

### Dashboard

- Show the gauge icon to the left of the header title, tinted to match the title color (`var(--accent)`) via a CSS `mask` so it tracks the accent dynamically. Served from a new `GET /icon.svg` route that locates `resources/icon.svg` in both run contexts (bundled `.vsix` — `python/dashboard.py` → `../resources/icon.svg`; and standalone repo — `vscode-extension/resources/icon.svg`).
- Renamed the header from "Claude Code Usage Dashboard" to "Claude Code Usage".
- Fixed charts not resizing when the window is narrowed (they only adjusted on the next data refresh). Grid cards now set `min-width: 0` so the container can shrink below the canvas's intrinsic width, letting Chart.js's `ResizeObserver` fire live. Widening already worked.
- Debounced chart resizing with Chart.js `resizeDelay` (150 ms) so dragging the window narrower no longer re-renders the canvases on every tick.
- Cost by Model, Recent Sessions, Cost by Project, and Cost by Project & Branch tables now reveal rows in steps — 10 → 25 → 50 — with `Show more ▾` / `Show less ▴` controls at the bottom right (`Show less` appears only once a table is expanded past the first step). Rendering is capped at 50 rows for performance; past that the footer shows a "Download CSV to see all (N)" link (N = total rows) that triggers the same export as the table's CSV button, alongside Show less (which resets to 10). Sorting re-applies to the full data set, so the visible rows always reflect the active sort; the control is hidden when a table has 10 or fewer rows. Clicking Show less also scrolls back to the top of that table.
- Styled scrollbars to match the VS Code dark UI (no arrows) via `::-webkit-scrollbar`: a 21px-wide gutter with a `#28292B` thumb (`#8B8B8D` on hover) over a `#121314` track. The dashboard's webview iframe doesn't inherit VS Code's `--vscode-*` theme variables, so the colors are set directly.
- Added a CSV export for the Cost by Model table (`exportModelCSV`), used by its "Download CSV to see more" link.
- Adjusted the page background to `#191A1B`.
- Updated the pricing footnote date to "as of May 2026".

## v1.2.1 — 2026-05-29

### Extension

- Bundle the Python sources (`cli.py`, `scanner.py`, `dashboard.py`) inside the `.vsix` so the extension works standalone — the only end-user dependency is Python 3.8+ on `PATH`. The `vscode:prepublish` script copies the files from the repo root at package time, so each extension version embeds the matching Python snapshot.
- Auto-start the dashboard when the user clicks the sidebar icon (no Command Palette step needed). `DashboardSidebar` accepts an `onShow` callback wired to `openDashboard()`; in-flight startup coalescing on the host side keeps clicks idempotent.
- Discover `cli.py` in any open VS Code workspace folder — covers the "cloned the repo into c:\github\claude-usage and opened it in VS Code" case that the original monorepo-sibling fallback couldn't reach for installed extensions.
- Platform-aware error messages: missing-Python guidance now leads with the right install command (python.org installer on Windows with the "Add to PATH" reminder; `brew install python` on macOS; distro package manager on Linux). The Homebrew suggestion is hidden on Windows.
- Add a dedicated [vscode-extension/README.md](vscode-extension/README.md) for the marketplace listing.
- Real gauge icon shipped (was a placeholder).
- 4 new install-mode tests for bundled discovery + ordering; 4 sidebar tests for the auto-start callback. Total extension test count: 74.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-05-29

### Distribution

- Add a VS Code extension under [`vscode-extension/`](vscode-extension/). Spawns the existing Python dashboard server in the background and embeds it via a webview iframe — no UI rewrite, all existing charts and filters reused. Activity-bar sidebar entry, four commands (`Open Dashboard`, `Rescan`, `Restart Server`, `Show Logs`), and two settings (`pythonPath`, `cliPath`, `port`). 63 tests covering Python discovery, install-mode resolution, port allocation, server lifecycle, and webview HTML/CSP. Built as `.vsix`, installable via [scripts/install.sh / install.ps1](vscode-extension/scripts/).
- Auto-discovery: extension finds `claude-usage` on PATH (Homebrew users) or a sibling `cli.py` in the monorepo (dev). Setting overrides for both Python interpreter and CLI path.

### CI

- Add `.github/workflows/extension-ci.yml`: clean Ubuntu, `npm ci && npx tsc && npm test && npm run package`, uploads the `.vsix` as an artifact on every push to DEV/main that touches `vscode-extension/`.

## v1.1.2 — 2026-05-29

### Project / docs

- Add auto-tag-from-CHANGELOG GitHub Actions workflow ([.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml](.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml)). Every push to `main` that adds a new `## vX.Y.Z` heading to `CHANGELOG.md` now creates a matching lightweight git tag automatically. CHANGELOG is the source of truth; tags are a deterministic projection of it.
- Revise versioning convention in AGENTS.md: lightweight tags driven by the workflow are the new baseline (supersedes the "annotated, by hand" rule introduced in v1.1.1). No formal GitHub Releases at any cadence.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-05-28

### Packaging

- Add Homebrew formula at `Formula/claude-usage.rb` and install instructions; `claude-usage` is now installable on macOS/Linux without `git clone` (#46, #71, thanks @HaydenHaines)

### Project / docs

- Adopt versioning convention: SemVer with tags on every release, formal GitHub Releases only for major versions. Documented in AGENTS.md.
- Tighten `/triage` routine to leave the CHANGELOG date as `TBD` and let the maintainer fill it in at tag time.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-05-28

### Dashboard

- Fix `ReferenceError: cutoff is not defined` in the hourly filter that blanked the entire dashboard (#73, thanks @thomasleveil)
- Fix hourly chart ignoring the range upper bound for `week` / `month` / `prev-month` ranges
- Fix 404 on dashboard URLs containing query strings (`?range=...&models=...`) so reloads and bookmarks work, with regression tests (#81, thanks @jakduch)
- Fix blank dashboard for users whose data only contains non-billable / unknown models, or rows with empty model names: `COALESCE(NULLIF(model, ''), 'unknown')` normalises empty-string models (in both SELECT and GROUP BY so mixed NULL + '' rows collapse to a single "unknown" group), and the default selection falls back to all models when no billable models exist (#109, thanks @HaydenHaines)
- Use `ThreadingHTTPServer` so a slow `/api/data` no longer blocks other dashboard requests (#79, thanks @jakduch)
- Add a `Today` range button (#112, thanks @Fruhji)

### Scanner

- Fix incremental scan not updating `first_timestamp` when a newly discovered session's records arrive out of order (#111, thanks @Fruhji)

### Project / docs

- Adopt `AGENTS.md` as the canonical agent guide (shared with Codex); `CLAUDE.md` is now a thin `@AGENTS.md` import
- Codify the rule that future PR merges must preserve original-author commits (`merge --no-ff` for full merges, `cherry-pick` for partial, `Co-Authored-By` trailers when applying hunks manually)
- Drop unused `.claude/launch.json`

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-09

- Fix token counts inflated ~2x by deduplicating streaming events that share the same message ID
- Fix session cost totals that were inflated when sessions spanned multiple JSONL files
- Fix pricing to match current Anthropic API rates (Opus $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5)
- Add CI test suite (84 tests) and GitHub Actions workflow running on every PR
- Add sortable columns to Sessions, Cost by Model, and new Cost by Project tables
- Add CSV export for Sessions and Projects (all filtered data, not just top 20)
- Add Rescan button to dashboard for full database rebuild
- Add Xcode project directory support and `--projects-dir` CLI option
- Non-Anthropic models (gemma, glm, etc.) no longer incorrectly charged at Sonnet rates
- CLI and dashboard now both compute costs per-turn for consistent results
